# MNIST-Digit-Classifier
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to implement a fully connected neural network (ANN) for classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize digits and predict their corresponding classes.

The project includes:
* Preprocessing MNIST data (normalization & reshaping)
* Building a neural network with multiple Dense layers
* Training & validating the model
* Evaluating model accuracy on test data
* Making predictions on unseen digits
* Plotting training vs. validation accuracy

## Installation & Setup
Ensure you have Python (3.7+) installed. Required libraries:
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib

### For Linux:
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy

## Run the Project
python mnist_digit_classifier.py
